# Privacy Friendly Finance Manager

The Privacy Friendly Finance Manager can be used to monitor and manage personal financials. This app belongs to the group of Privacy Friendly Apps developed by the Karlsruher Institute for Technology (KIT). 

## Motivation

Nowadays there are many apps that require many or all permissions available in Android in order to be installed. However these apps do not always need all of the permissions they ask for. With this project we want to offer an app where the user can be sure that private information are not being used by the application. Further information can be found on https://secuso.org/pfa

## Download and more Information
